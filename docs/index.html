			<h1>Finding Food in the South Bronx</h1>
		
			<p> Since the onset of COVID-19, the number of New Yorkers facing food scarcity has risen to 2 million. That means 2 million New Yorkers are unsure where their next meal will come from. Finding nutritious, affordable food in the South Bronx has long been an issue. In the area, bodegas far outnumber grocery stores, which are overly priced and difficult to get to. Some residents travelled outside the burough to find cheaper, better fresh foods—an option made more fraught by the threat of the coronavrius. Bronxites who rely on food pantries, have seen longstanding sources of food close as elderly volunteers no longer felt safe keeping the sites open. </p>

			<p>If you're struggling to find food during this time, know you're not alone and know that there are resources you can use to keep yourself and your family fed. The City government, alongside a variety of non-profit and religious organizations continue to serve the South Bronx, including a number of food pantries, markets, soup kitchens and meal distribution sites.</p>

			<p>Please use the directory below to find the best option for your family.</p>

				<a href="#bottom-food-pantries"><h3>Food Pantries</h3></a>
				<p>Food pantries primarily provide shelf-stable pantry goods like canned foods and dry goods. Some may provide long-lasting fresh goods like onions, potatoes and carrots. Much of what may be provided is snack-like or quick-fix meals like boxed macaroni-and-cheese or Rice-a-Roni. Please call to confirm opening hours as many organizations' schedules have changed with little or no notice due to the pandemic.</p>

			<div class="foodtypes market">
				<a href="#bottom-food-market"><img src="images/market.png"/></a>
				<a href="#bottom-food-market"><h3>Markets</h3></a>
				<p>Green markets are a great option for fresh produce. Due to the pandemic, expect longer lines and wait times. Some markets, are providing more shelf-stable items, and limiting customers ability to pick their own items to reduce contamination.</p>
				<p>GrowNYC's Greenmarket Farmers Market, accepts SNAP and EBT benefits, and through the Health Bucks initiative for every, $5 of EBT spent in the market, you'll recieve a $2 Health Bucks coupon to buy even more produce.</p>

			<div class="foodtypes kitchen">
				<a href="#bottom-food-soupkitchen"><img src="images/soupkitchen.png"/></a>
				<a href="#bottom-food-soupkitchen"><h3>Soup Kitchens</h3></a>
				<p>Most of the Soup Kitchens in the South Bronx are run by religious organizations, and operate once a week. Attendance at these kitchens has significantly increased. Expect long lines and wait times. Some no longer provide a space to eat on site. Instead visitors may be asked to take their meal to-go and eat elsewhere. Locations that still allow on-site eating will require a mask to enter.

			<div class="foodtypes grabngo">
				<a href="#bottom-food-grabngo"><img src="images/grabngo.png"/></a>
				<a href="#bottom-food-grabngo"><h3>Grab-n-Go Meals</h3></a>
				<p>Most prepared meals are provided either through local restaurants or through the City government. The Department of Education's Grab-N-Go meals, which generally have been provided to school-age children during the summer are available for all ages during the pandemic. Text “NYC FOOD” to 877-877 to find distribution sites and times.
